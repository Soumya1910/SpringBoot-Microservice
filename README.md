# SpringBoot-Microservice
This repo is for sample example of different components of Micro Services using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud

# Branch Details
## 1_Basic_Microservice_Implementation:
	1. Basic Order Service Implementation (Running on 8001 Port)
	2. Basic Payment Service Implementation (Running on 8002 Port)
	3. Call order service method from payment service - P2P call.
	4. 

```
http://localhost:8001/api/v1/orders/
{
    "item_name": "Pen",
    "quantity": 20,
    "price_per_item": 25.7
}

{
    "item_name": "Pencil",
    "quantity": 10,
    "price_per_item": 15.7
}
```

```
http://localhost:8002/api/v1/payment/
{
    "paymentAmount": 75,
    "orderId": 1,
    "paymentMode": "Cheque"
}
```

## 2_Eureka_Server_Registry:
    1. Service-Registry - Eureka Server implementation
    2. Enable eureka client configuration in both Order-Service and Payment Service.
    3. Change the URL of Order Service in Payment Service.
    4. Provide eureka-client maven dependency with cloud dependencymanagement and spring cloud version.
    5. Run service-registry application first (http://localhost:8761/)
    6. Then run order-service and payment-service.
    7. Every service should be registered with Eureka Server now.

## 3_Cloud_Gateway_Implementation:
    Till now when we are calling Order-Service and Payment-Service, we are invoking corresponding individual URL. There should be a common service where all the entry point should be registered and request should be invoked to this URL.
    All the requests can be made to a single endpoint i.e. http://localhost:7090
    ```
    http://localhost:7090/api/v1/orders/
    http://localhost:7090/api/v1/payment/
    ```

## 4_Config_Server:
    Common Eureka related configuration can be placed in a centralized store from where application configuration can be loaded.
    Configuration should be loaded after starting the servers, not during loading the eureka client microservice. Hence this configuration should be kept in bootstrap file.
    Application should be started in below order:
    1. Service-Registry
    2. Config-Service
    3. Cloud-Gateway
    4. Order-Service
    5. Payment-Service
